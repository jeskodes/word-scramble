<br>

[Animal Scramble](https://jeskodes.github.io/word-scramble/) is an anagram game where the player has to unscramble the jumbled up animal words.
The game has been designed to be quick to start with obvious game play and few explanations.

The target players are people of all ages who are looking to distract themselves for a few minutes with a lighthearted word game.

## Design

### Research

#### Features Research

The original idea for the project came from my enjoyment of anagram and code word games. The Conundra app is great to play to pass the
time, especially while waiting for appointments or travelling. I wanted to develop something more basic, but similar to Conundra.

<br>
<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="24%" src="documentation/conundra-demo.gif">
</p>
<br>

Features of Conundra:

- Select three different levels: Practice, Easy, Hard.
- Gameplay: Buttons to scramble the word again, pass, start again. Scoreboard at the end showing correct and incorrect guesses.

#### Design Research

- I researched word game apps for layout and colour palette ideas.
- The main findings were that the apps used two - three colours, usually one being white, and green was a common main colour.
- Astra Wordsearch and Wordle-type games are two examples:

</p>
<br>

##### Tutorial Research and Development:

I searched for JavaScript word scramble tutorials to develop my knowlege of JavaScript and which included the basic features I wanted to include in the game.

A large part of the functionality of Animal Scramble is based on a tutorial by Laurence Svekis: [JavaScript Create 5 Fun Word Games by Laurence Svekis](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-games/learn/lecture/22686281?start=120#content). Additions, deletions, substitutions and changes are noted in the code.

### Design

- A minimally cluttered container which the user can pick up and play almost immediately.
- Intuitive game play: minimal text on the page and only a few instructions needed to understand game play.
- Slight use of border-radius for container, buttons and input box.
- Typeface: Serif font for labels such as name of game, buttons - slightly 70's style; used [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
  Patua One. Sans-serif font for input box and displaying correct word; used [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) Roboto.
- Colour Palette: Despite research that word games tend to use a more muted colour palette with an emphasis on greens and white, the Animal Scramble game is targeted at users of all ages from 10yrs upwards. Animal Scramble's aim is to be lighthearted and fun. Therefore a more brightly coloured, retro theme and typeface was chosen with a colour palette to reflect this:

## Testing

### BUGS

#### Accessibility Bugs

**BUG**
- The player is using tab controls.
- The player presses "Enter" to play the game and for the next word.
- The winChecker() function - which checks if the words match - immediately checks the word and the player cannot make a guess. The game cannot be played without using the mouse.

<br>
<p align = "center">
  <img src="documentation/bug-accessibility-can't-use-tab-controls.gif" width="60%"/>
</p>
</br>

**Fixes**

1. Make input textbox visible throughout. This resulted in two further bugs: - The target word persisted and any press on “Enter” resulted in getting an infinite number of correct scores on the same correct guess. - The input (inWord) could be displayed but was disabled.
<p align = "center">
  <img src="documentation\fix1-bug-ax-tab.png" width="60%"/>
</p>

2. Added eventListener to stop default behaviour when pressing Enter - did not fix(removed).
3. Separated out functions to create a separate function after winChecker().
4. Added `btn.onfocus();` after function checked if words matched - this worked to automatically focus on the button but did not fix the bug.

**Result**
- Unable to fix the bug. This would be targeted in later versions with a separate function at the point of refreshing the scrambled word. 
It is disappointing that Animal Scramble V1 is not accessible using tab controls.

#### Game Play General Bugs 
**BUG** 
- The output(myWordsFromJson) does not unscramble the target word, even if they guess incorrectly so the player won't know what the right answer was; this could cause the player frustration. 

**Fix**
 - Add line of code to winChecker() fucntion - both correct and incorrect guesses: 

 <br>
<p align = "center">
  <img src="documentation/bug-fix-unscramble-word.png" width="60%"/>
</p>
</br>


 **BUG**
 - Gameplay does not stop at 5 turns and can play an infinite amout of times if keep guessing incorrectly. 

  <br>
<p align = "center">
  <img src="documentation/BUG-infinite-turns.png" width="33%"/>
</p>
</br>


 **Fix**
 -Create maxGuesses variable to count guesses and add to gamePlay() function; stop play at 5 guesses.  


```javascript 

function gamePlay() {
  if (myWordsFromJson.length <= 0 || maxGuesses === 5) {
    //EDIT: Add in "or" maxGuesses for game over.
    console.log("game over");
    console.log(maxGuesses);`
    
```

**BUG**
- Game play stops at 5 turns but the player has no way to play again unless they refresh the page. 

**Fix**
- Add restart-btn. 

```javascript
const restart = document.createElement("button");
```

- Add EventListener to restart button to refresh page when clicked. 

```javascript
restart.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  window.location.reload();
});
```

**BUG**
- When refresh page the transition is jerky. 

**Fix**
- Add CSS animation to start of game to mask. 

**BUG**
- User testing reported that on android there was no way to press "Enter" to skip; the "go" button did not work. 

**Fix**

- Added EventListener for pressing "go" when focus on input box = carry out winChecker function. 

```javascript

inWord.addEventListener("keyup", (e) => {
  console.log(e);
  if (inWord.value.length === game.sel.length || e.key === "Enter") {
    winChecker(); //run the winChecker function
  }
});

```

#### Textbox Specific Bugs

**BUG**
- Initially used four animal words in array inside script.js to scramble; the words were four letters in lenght or shorter. 
- Added much big array of animal words to separate js file and the text went outside of input and output boxes. 

**Fix**
- Added classes to inWord(textbox) and myWordsFromJson (scrambled words) and styled with CSS. 
- Additionally added classes to start and refresh buttons in order to style in CSS. 

**BUG**
- User testing on ios reported that the game was showing an incorrect response as correct. 
- Investigation revealed that the words were being autocorrected across multiple devices. 
- Investigation with DevTools showed correct guess in console log as incorrect: 



<p align = "center">
  <img src="documentation/BUG-case-sensitive-textbox.png" width="60%"/>
</p>

**Fix**
- Add autocomplete = "off" spellcheck = "false" to input html. 

```html

<section class = "game-play">
  <div id="game-area">
    <h1 id="heading-wordscramble">Animal Scramble</h1>
      <input type="text" class ="input-text" id = "input-word" name = "inputtext" autocomplete = "off" spellcheck = "false" autocomplete = "off" placeholder = 'Press Enter to Skip' aria-label="Type word here" 

```


**BUG**

- Can enter numbers and special characters into input box. 

**Fix**
- Add JavaScript code snippet to html to only allow letters. 

```javascript 

      onkeypress="return (event.charCode > 64 && 
	    event.charCode < 91) || (event.charCode > 96 && event.charCode < 123)"
      
```

**BUG**

- Input box is case sensitive and counting guesses in lowercase and caps as wrong. 

**Fix**

- Add toLowerCase() to winChecker() function. 

```javascript

function winChecker() {
  if (inWord.value.toLowerCase() == game.sel) {
    //EDIT: added .toLowerCase()
    
```
### Verification

### Responsiveness

  <br>
<p align = "center">
  <img src="documentation/animal-scramble-responsive.png" width="60%"/>
</p>
</br>

[Animal Scramble](https://jeskodes.github.io/word-scramble/) is responsive across a large range of devices. There are no media queries needed as:
-  The main game container div is set at a fixed size using rem.
-  The input box, buttons and output div are also set to a fixed size using rem so the format does not break when resized. 
- Responsiveness was tested using Chrome DevTools, [Responsivedesignchecker.com](https://responsivedesignchecker.com), and user testing on Android Phone, ios ipad air 2, iphone SE 2020, iphone 10, windows laptop 1600 x 1200.
